# Platformer-Game
 A platforming game created using pygame that creates player, world, and enemy textures/sprites. Game features collision detection between player and all world/enemy sprites, gravity and velocity, input detection, reactive buttons, level select, and music.

To run the game, clone this repository, then run the platformer.py file. To create, load, or edit stages, run the level_editor.py file. Pressing the save button overwrites any data from pre-existing stages, and pressing the load button loads what data exists for that stage. Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate to different stages.
